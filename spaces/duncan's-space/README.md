For a sequence $x = (x_n)$, define $N(n,x)$ to be the number of terms of $x$ which are less than $n$. For two sequences $x$ and $y$, let $k(x,y)$ be the least $n$ such that $x_n \neq y_n$. 

Let $X$ be the set of strictly increasing sequences of positive integers such that $\delta(x) = \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty} N(n,x)/n$ exists. Define a metric $d$ on $X$ by $d(x,y) = \frac{1}{k(x,y)} + |\delta(x) - \delta(y)|$ (and $d(x,x) = 0$). The topology generated by this metric is called Duncan's Space.
