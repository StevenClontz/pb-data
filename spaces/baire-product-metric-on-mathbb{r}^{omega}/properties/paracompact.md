Since every subspace of $(X, \tau)$ is paracompact, so too is $(X, \tau^{*})$. For if $U$ is an open covering of $(X, \tau^{*})$, then the collection of $\tau$-interiors of sets in $U$ covers some subset of $X$. Thus it has a locally finite refinement $U^{*}$ which covers all of $X$ except perhaps certain points of $D$. But these single points may be added to $U^{*}$ to produce a locally finite refinement of $U$ which covers all of $X$.
