Since $D = X - \mathbb{Q}$, $X - D$ is countable, and we can cover each point $r_i$ of $X - D$ with an open interval $J_i$ of length $2^{-i}$, thus leaving uncountably many points of $D$ uncovered. The open covering of $X$ consisting of the intervals $J_i$ together with each point $p \in D$ has no countable subcover. So $(X, \tau^{*})$ is not Lindelof.
