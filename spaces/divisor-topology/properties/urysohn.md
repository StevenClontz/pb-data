* [T000143] [Locally Compact|P000023]
* [T000141] [Completely Normal|P000014]
* [T000146] [Second Countable|P000027]
* [I000086] [Urysohn|P000009] => [$T_{2 \frac{1}{2}}$|P000004]
* [I000032] [$T_{2 \frac{1}{2}}$|P000004] => [$T_2$|P000003]
* [I000027] ([$T_2$|P000003] + [Locally Compact|P000023]) => [$T_{3 \frac{1}{2}}$|P000006]
* [I000149] ~[$T_{3 \frac{1}{2}}$|P000006] => ~[Completely Regular|P000012]
* [I000035] [Completely Regular|P000012] => [Regular|P000011]
* [I000029] ([Regular|P000011] + [Second Countable|P000027]) => [Completely Normal|P000014]
