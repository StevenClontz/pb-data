name: Discrete Irrational Extension of $\mathbb{R}$
---
If $X = \mathbb{R}$, and if $D$ is a dense subset of the Euclidean space $(X, \tau)$ with a dense compliment, we define $\tau^{*}$, the discrete rational extension of $\tau$, to be the topology generated from $\tau$ by adding each point of $D$ as an open set. (Then any subset of $D$ will be open in $\tau^{*}$.) The Discrete Irrational Extension of $\mathbb{R}$ is the space that results when $D = \mathbb{P}$, the set of irrational numbers.
