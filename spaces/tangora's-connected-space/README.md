Let $X = \{\frac{m}{2^n}\} \subset \mathbb{Q}$ be the dyadic rationals, $Y = \mathbb{Q} \setminus X$ and $Z = \mathbb{P}$ the irrationals. Extend the usual topology on $\mathbb{R}$ by defining $X$ and $Y$ open along with sets of the form $\{z\} \cup \{w \in X \cup Y\ |\ |w-z|<\delta\}$ for $\delta > 0$.
