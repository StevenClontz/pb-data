Let $\{C_i\ |\ i \in \omega\}$ be a collection of dense subsets of $\mathbb{Q}$. Let $X = \{(r,i) \in \mathbb{Q} \times \omega\ |\ r \in C_i\} \cup \{\omega\}$ as a set and define a topology on $X$ as follows: neighborhoods of points of the form $(r,2n)$ are open intervals $U_\epsilon(r,2n) = \{(t,2n)\ |\ |r-t|<\epsilon\}$; neighborhoods of points of the form $(r,2n-1)$ have the form $V_\epsilon(r,2n-1) = \{(t,m)\ |\ |r-t|<\epsilon, |m-n|\leq 1\}$; neighborhoods of $\omega$ have the form $W_n(\omega) = \{(s,i)\ |\ i \geq 2n\}$.
