Suppose $A$ and $B$ are separated subsets of $X$. Then each point $a = (a_1, a_2) \in A$ has a neighborhood $N_\epsilon(a)$ or $M_\epsilon(a)$ which is disjoint from $B$. If $a \in \Delta$ we may assume that $M_\epsilon(a) \cap \Delta = \{(x,x)\ |\ |x-a_1| < \epsilon\}$. Then $U = \bigcup_{a \in A \setminus} \Delta N_{\epsilon/2}(a) \cup \bigcup_{a \in A \cap \Delta} M_{\epsilon/2}(a)$ is an open set containing $A$. Define $V$ containing $B$ similarly. Clearly $U \cap V = \emptyset$.
