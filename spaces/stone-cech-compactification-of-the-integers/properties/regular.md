* [T000410] [Compact|P000016]
* [T000411] [Extremally Disconnected|P000049]
* [I000035] [Completely Regular|P000012] => [Regular|P000011]
* [I000149] ~[$T_{3 \frac{1}{2}}$|P000006] => ~[Completely Regular|P000012]
* [I000027] ([$T_2$|P000003] + [Locally Compact|P000023]) => [$T_{3 \frac{1}{2}}$|P000006]
* [I000007] [Strongly Locally Compact|P000024] => [Locally Compact|P000023]
* [I000032] [$T_{2 \frac{1}{2}}$|P000004] => [$T_2$|P000003]
* [I000006] [Compact|P000016] => [Strongly Locally Compact|P000024]
