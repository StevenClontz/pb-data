Suppose, for contradiction, that $\mathcal{B}$ is a $\sigma$-locally finite base for the Altered Long Line. One can form a $\sigma$-locally finite base for the Long Line (which is [impossible](http://topology.jdabbs.com/traits/5996)) by replacing every neighborhood $U_\beta (p)$ appearing in $\mathcal{B}$ with $U_\beta (p) \setminus \{p\}$. Therefore, $\mathcal{B}$ is not a $\sigma$-locally finite base for the Altered Long Line.
