Suppose $\mathcal{U} = \cup \mathcal{U}_n$ were a basis with each $\mathcal{U}_n$ locally finite. Since $\{x\}$ is open for each $x \neq 0$, some $\mathcal{U}_n$ must contain infinitely many singletons. But any open set about $0$ must contain $(-1,1)$ and so meets infinitely many members of that $\mathcal{U}_n$.
