Take any element of $X$, call it $x$. If $x \neq 0$, then choose the basis to be the set containing $\{x\}$. Since singletons are open in the topology, the basis contains a countable number of open sets. If $x = 0$, then choose the basis to be the set containing the interval $(-1,1)$. By definition, $(-1,1)$ is open and therefore the basis contains a countable number of open sets.
