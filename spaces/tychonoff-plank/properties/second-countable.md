[[Proof]]

* [T015384] [Completely Normal|P000014]
* [T015365] [$T_2$|P000003]
* [T015351] [Compact|P000016]
* [I000029] ([Regular|P000011] + [Second Countable|P000027]) => [Completely Normal|P000014]
* [I000146] ~[$T_3$|P000005] => ~[Regular|P000011]
* [I000115] [$T_{3 \frac{1}{2}}$|P000006] => [$T_3$|P000005]
* [I000027] ([$T_2$|P000003] + [Locally Compact|P000023]) => [$T_{3 \frac{1}{2}}$|P000006]
* [I000007] [Strongly Locally Compact|P000024] => [Locally Compact|P000023]
* [I000006] [Compact|P000016] => [Strongly Locally Compact|P000024]
