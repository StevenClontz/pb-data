Note that if $A \subset \mathbb{R}$ is dense in some interval $[a,b]$ in the standard topology then $A \subset X$ is not compact. For if $\{b_i\}$ is a countable sequence converging to $b$, the collection $\{(-\infty,b_0),[b_i,b_{i+1}),[b,+\infty)\}$ is a countable cover of $A$ with no finite subcover. 

If $X = \cup A_i$ is a countable union of compact subsets then $\mathbb{R} = \cup A_i$ is a countable union of nowhere dense subsets, contradicting the Baire Category theorem.
