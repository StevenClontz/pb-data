No point of $D$ is ever the limit point of a set $A$ in $(X, \tau^{*})$, while a point of $X - D$ is a limit point of $A$ iff it is a $\tau$-limit point of $A$. Thus if $A$ and $B$ are separated subsets of $(X, \tau^{*})$, then $A - (A \cap D)$ and $B - (B \cap D)$ are separated subsets of $(X, \tau)$ and are therefore contained in disjoint open sets $N, M \in \tau$. Then since every subset of $D$ is open, $N \cup (A \cap D)$ and $M \cup (B \cap D)$ are disjoint neighborhoods of $A$ and $B$ in $(X, \tau^{*})$. Thus, since $(X, \tau^{*})$ is already known to be $T_1$, it is also $T_5$.
