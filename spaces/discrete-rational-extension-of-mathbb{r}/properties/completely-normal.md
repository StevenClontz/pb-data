[[Proof]]

* [T001086] [Second Countable|P000027]
* [T000170] [Metrizable|P000053]
* [I000029] ([Regular|P000011] + [Second Countable|P000027]) => [Completely Normal|P000014]
* [I000146] ~[$T_3$|P000005] => ~[Regular|P000011]
* [I000020] [Metrizable|P000053] => ([$T_3$|P000005] + [$\sigma$-Locally Finite Base|P000054])
