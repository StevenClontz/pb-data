Let $X = 2^{2^\mathbb{R}}$. For $r \in \mathbb{R}$, let $x_r: 2^\mathbb{R} \rightarrow 2$ by $x_r(\lambda) = 1 \iff r \in \lambda$. Let $M = \{x_r: r \in \mathbb{R}\}$. Bing's Discrete Extension Space is the set $X$ where points of $M$ have their usual product neighborhoods and points of $X \setminus M$ are isolated.
