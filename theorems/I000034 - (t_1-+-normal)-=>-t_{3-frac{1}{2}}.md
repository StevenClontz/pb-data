By Urysohn's Lemma, if $X$ is normal, for any pair of disjoint closed sets $A$ and $B$ there is a function $f:X \rightarrow [0,1]$ with sending $A$ to 0 and $B$ to 1. If $X$ is $T_1$ points are closed, for any point $a$ and closed set $B$ disjoint from $a$, there is a function $f:X \rightarrow [0,1]$ with sending $a$ to 0 and $B$ to 1.
