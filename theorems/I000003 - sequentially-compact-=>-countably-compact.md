If $X$ is not countably compact then there is some countable open cover $\{U_n\}_{n \in \omega}$ of $X$ with no finite subcover. Let $x_n \in X \setminus \cup_{i < n} U_i \neq \emptyset$ for all $n \in \omega$. Then for any $p \in X$, $p \in U_n$ for some least $n$ and so no infinite subsequence of $\{x_n\}$ converges to $p$.
